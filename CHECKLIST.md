# üìã Error Documentation Checklist

This checklist tracks the progress of documenting TypeScript errors. Each error gets its own detailed documentation file with regex patterns, suggestions, and examples. The goal is to make sure all errors get validated correctly and can show proper detail.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Requirements

### üéØ Objectives
1. **Data Collection**: Fetch TypeScript errors from Microsoft's repository
2. **Data Processing**: Add regex patterns, suggestions, and examples
3. **Documentation**: Generate markdown files for each error
4. **Validation**: Check data completeness and accuracy

### üîÑ Development Workflow
```
1. Fetch Error Data ‚Üí 2. Validate Gaps ‚Üí 3. Enrich Content ‚Üí 4. Generate Docs ‚Üí 5. Test & Verify
```

## üìä Progress Legend
- ‚úÖ **Completed** - Full documentation with regex, suggestions, and examples
- üîÑ **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ‚è≥ **Pending** - Not started yet
- ‚ùå **Blocked** - Cannot proceed due to issues
